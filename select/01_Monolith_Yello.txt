I got that James Dean (So it's gonna be forever)
Daydream look in my eye (Or it's gonna go down in flames)
And you got (You can tell me when it's over)
That red lip classic thing that I like (If the high was worth the pain)
And when we go crashing down (Got a long list of ex-lovers)
We come back every time (they'll tell you I'm insane)
'Cause we never go out of style ('cause you know I love the players)
Out of style (And you love the game)

Ohhh
"Midnight"
You come and pick me up, "no headlights"
"Long drive"
Could end in burning "flames or paradise"

"Cause we're young and we're reckless"
We'll take this way too far
"It'll leave you breathless"
Or with a nasty scar
"Got a long list of ex-lovers"
They'll tell you I'm insane
"But I've got a blank space, baby"
And I'll write your name

I got that James Dean day dream look in my eye
And you got that "red lip classic" thing that I like
And when we "go crashing down, we" come back every time.
Cause we never "go out of style"
We never go out of style

Fade into view
It's been a while since I have even "heard from you" (heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

I got that James Dean (So it's gonna be forever)
Daydream look in your eye (Or it's gonna go down in flames)
And you got (You can tell me when it's over)
That red lip classic thing that you like (If the high was worth the pain)
And when we go crashing down (Got a long list of ex-lovers)
We come back every time (they'll tell you I'm insane)
'Cause we never go out of style ('cause you know I love the players)
Out of style (And you love the game)

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (got that long hair, slicked back)
We'll take this way too far (white t-shirt)
It'll leave you breathless (And you got that good girl faith)
Or with a nasty scar (and a tight little skirt)
Got a long list of ex-lovers (we go crashing down)
They'll tell you I'm insane (we come back every time)
But I've got a blank space, baby (we never go out of style)
And I'll write your name (Out of Style)

"Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise"
